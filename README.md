# OAUTH Client Assertions

Three applications are using in this setup, an API which uses the access token, an OAuth client application implemented as a console app and a OAuth server, implemented using ASP.NET Core and Duende IdentityServer. OAuth client credentials is used to acquire the access token and the signed JWT is used to authenticate the client request.

> NOTE: The code in this repository was created from the IdentityServer samples and Duende IdentityServer.
